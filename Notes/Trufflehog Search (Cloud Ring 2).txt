Trufflehog Search (Cloud Ring 2)
Objective: get name of the file that has AWS credentials?
Method: run trufflehog to find secrets committed to https://haugfactory.com/orcadmin/aws_scripts

1) Search for secrets in the Git repo and output into output.txt (I had a hard time with the terminal not scrolling so outputting and viewing through a file instead)
  ~$ trufflehog git https://haugfactory.com/orcadmin/aws_scripts.git > output.txt
  ~$ nano output.txt

2) Look at an older commit to confirm SSH keys were committed (output to output.txt because scrolling issues)
  ~$ git checkout 106d33e1ffd53eea753c1365eafc6588398279b5 > output.txt
  ~$ nano output.txt

3) Answer: put_policy.py
